## 🚀 Running in Production
This project uses GitHub Actions to run automated docker builds, you can find them in this repo's [Package Registry](https://github.com/lolPants/dreddit/packages). A sample Docker Compose file has been provided for you to use as a reference.

### 📝 Configuration
Dreddit is configured with a `config.json` file located in the `config` directory. A [JSON schema](https://github.com/lolPants/dreddit/blob/master/config/config.schema.json) for IDE integration can be located in the same directory.

Dreddit also requires a Redis database for persistence between restarts. This is configured using environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for documentation.

Finally, to parse Imgur URLs an Imgur Application Client ID is required. You can generate one in the [Imgur Account Settings](https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps). This is also passed as an environment variable, again refer to `.env.example` for more information.
